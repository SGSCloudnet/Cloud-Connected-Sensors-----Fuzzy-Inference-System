# Cloud-Connected-Sensors-----Fuzzy-Inference-System
In this project, different types of available sensors and the data acquired from them is published to an IoT cloud service like ThingSpeak using Arduino as the microcontroller board and Esp8266 12E as the wifi module.The wifi module will enable the Arduino board to be connected to the internet , thereby facilitating web data transfer . The uploaded sensor data will be interpretted and displayed in the form of graphs. Uploaded sensor data is also inputted into a fuzzy inference engine whose output is used in the creation of a response system to create alerts incase of fire/gas leaks enabling more functionality in this IoT based prototype. Finally we look at some real life applications where this type of a project could be scaled up and used in different ways.
